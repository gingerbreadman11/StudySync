# StudySync
The Study Phase Planner is an app designed to help students efficiently plan their study phases leading up to exams. Users input details such as exam dates, difficulty levels, available time, sleep requirements, travel time, and meal preferences. The app then generates a personalized study schedule, ensuring balanced preparation for each subject while taking into consideration personal needs. The goal is to create a flexible and adaptive study plan that maximizes productivity without compromising well-being. Just kidding there is no well-being at ETH.Â

## Important if you dont want to work on a branch you shouldnt change one of the main files directly! Create a new file and copy the code and then change it on the new file. otherwise There will be merge issues when 2 people are woring on the same file simultaniously.
